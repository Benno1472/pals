# The Inspiration Behind 'Pals'
As the influence of social media platforms continues to grow, so do the aspects which are linked to it, such as addiction and mental health issues. So we set out to create a social media platform that designed for you to use it less. 

# How 'Pals' Differs From Other Social Medias
Pals is different from popular social media platforms because if purposely lacks certain features that influence [social media addiction](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/social-media-addiction/) such as 'notifications', 'likes' and 'stories'. Those features were specifically designed to make users constantly stay connect to their phones, which ultimately has a negative impact on users. 

# Things We Learnt
Throughout the making of Pals we learnt how to use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a Python web framework used to create websites. We strengthened collaboration skills and practiced our Git skills using [github](https://github.com/).

# Usage
1. download the project from the [repo](https://github.com/rajanmaghera/hack-western-7)
2. run `python3 -m pip install Pillow django-friendship`
3. start the server with `python3 manage.py runserver`
4. navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/`
5. create an acccount and enjoy!
